# Selenium-Web-Crawler
This web crawler has been designed to scrape several thousand public notices from Arizona Newspapers Association website and
store them in an Excel file.

The website can be found here: http://www.publicnoticeads.com/az/search/advancedsearch.asp

The scraper has the ability to fill-out and submit a search form through Javascript, scrape the resulting dynamically populated
web pages and finally format and store all the scraped data into an Excel file.

A demo video showing the scraper in action can be found here:

A sample Excel file (output.xls) is committed in the repository to show the scrapped data from one scrapping run.
